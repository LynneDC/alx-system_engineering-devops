# SSH Configuration Project

This project focuses on SSH configuration and key management. It includes various tasks related to SSH key pair generation, client configuration, and server access setup.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several tasks, each with its own requirements and objectives:

### Task 0: Use a Private Key
- This task involves creating a Bash script that connects to a remote server using an SSH private key.
- Requirements include using SSH single-character flags and connecting as the user "ubuntu."

### Task 1: Create an SSH Key Pair
- In this task, you'll create an RSA key pair with specific requirements, including key name and passphrase protection.

### Task 2: Client Configuration File
- Configure the SSH client on your local machine to use the private key and refuse password authentication.

### Task 3: Let Me In!
- Add an SSH public key to your server to allow remote access via the "ubuntu" user.

### Task 4: Client Configuration File (with Puppet) [Advanced]
- Use Puppet to automate the configuration of the SSH client, making it use the private key and reject password authentication.

## Learning Objectives
By completing these tasks, you will gain knowledge and skills in the following areas:
- Understanding what a server is and where servers are typically located.
- Knowledge of SSH and how to create and use SSH key pairs.
- SSH client configuration to enhance security.
- Automation of SSH client configuration using Puppet (Advanced).

## Getting Started
Follow the instructions provided in each task's directory to complete the objectives. Use the provided Bash scripts and configuration files to meet the requirements.
